# Bloc Jams Music Player
This project focuses on introducing jQuery and getting familiar with the code. JavaScript and HTML are also present in this project. An analysis is also included to keep track of the development of the player step-by-step. DOM Scripting is also focused on greatly on this project and was challenged to discover why DOM Scripting is still used today despite developers turning to jQuery. After the project was completed, it was sent live to Netlify which is functioning live at this very moment.
